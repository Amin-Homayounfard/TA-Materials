# TA-Materials
A collection of resources I developed as a TA for Mathematical Statistics and Stochastic Processes courses. These materials include files used for homework assignments, solutions and recitation sessions.
The majority of homework questions are drawn from the following textbooks:

Mathematical Statistics:

• Mathematical Statistics by Jun Shao
• Statistical Inference by George Casella and Roger L. Berger
• Theory of Point Estimation by Erich L. Lehmann and George Casella
• Introduction to Mathematical Statistics by Robert V. Hogg, Allen T. Craig, and Joseph W. McKean
• Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis by John A. Rice

Stochastic Processes:

• Introduction to Stochastic Processes by Paul G. Hoel, Sidney C. Port, and Charles J. Stone
• Introduction to Probability Models by Sheldon M. Ross

Most of the solutions provided are developed by me. However, some solutions are derived from the official solutions manuals for the aforementioned textbooks.
